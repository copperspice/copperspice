    \class QAudioInput
    \brief The QAudioInput class provides an interface for receiving audio data from an audio input device.

    \inmodule QtMultimedia
    \ingroup  multimedia
    \since 4.6

    You can construct an audio input with the system's
    \l{QAudioDeviceInfo::defaultInputDevice()}{default audio input
    device}. It is also possible to create QAudioInput with a
    specific QAudioDeviceInfo. When you create the audio input, you
    should also send in the QAudioFormat to be used for the recording
    (see the QAudioFormat class description for details).

    To record to a file:

    QAudioInput lets you record audio with an audio input device. The
    default constructor of this class will use the systems default
    audio device, but you can also specify a QAudioDeviceInfo for a
    specific device. You also need to pass in the QAudioFormat in
    which you wish to record.

    Starting up the QAudioInput is simply a matter of calling start()
    with a QIODevice opened for writing. For instance, to record to a
    file, you can:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/audio/main.cpp 3
    \dots 4
    \snippet doc/src/snippets/audio/main.cpp 0

    This will start recording if the format specified is supported by
    the input device (you can check this with
    QAudioDeviceInfo::isFormatSupported(). In case there are any
    snags, use the error() function to check what went wrong. We stop
    recording in the \c stopRecording() slot.

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/audio/main.cpp 1

    At any point in time, QAudioInput will be in one of four states:
    active, suspended, stopped, or idle. These states are specified by
    the QAudio::State enum. You can request a state change directly through
    suspend(), resume(), stop(), reset(), and start(). The current
    state is reported by state(). QAudioOutput will also signal you
    when the state changes (stateChanged()).

    QAudioInput provides several ways of measuring the time that has
    passed since the start() of the recording. The \c processedUSecs()
    function returns the length of the stream in microseconds written,
    i.e., it leaves out the times the audio input was suspended or idle.
    The elapsedUSecs() function returns the time elapsed since start() was called regardless of
    which states the QAudioInput has been in.

    If an error should occur, you can fetch its reason with error().
    The possible error reasons are described by the QAudio::Error
    enum. The QAudioInput will enter the \l{QAudio::}{StoppedState} when
    an error is encountered.  Connect to the stateChanged() signal to
    handle the error:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/audio/main.cpp 2

    \sa QAudioOutput, QAudioDeviceInfo

    \section1 Symbian Platform Security Requirements

    On Symbian, processes which use this class must have the
    \c UserEnvironment platform security capability.  If the client
    process lacks this capability, calls to either overload of start()
    will fail.
    This failure is indicated by the QAudioInput object setting
    its error() value to \l{QAudio::OpenError} and then emitting a
    \l{stateChanged()}{stateChanged}(\l{QAudio::StoppedState}) signal.

    Platform security capabilities are added via the
    \l{qmake-variable-reference.html#target-capability}{TARGET.CAPABILITY}
    qmake variable.

/*!
     Uses the \a device as the QIODevice to transfer data.
     Passing a QIODevice allows the data to be transferred without any extra code.
     All that is required is to open the QIODevice. QAudioInput does not take
     ownership of \a device.

     The QAudioInput will write to the device when new data is available. You can
     subclass QIODevice and reimplement \l{QIODevice::}{writeData()} if you wish to
     access the data. If you simply want to save data to a file, you can pass a
     QFile to this function.

     If able to successfully get audio data from the systems audio device the
     state() is set to either QAudio::ActiveState or QAudio::IdleState,
     error() is set to QAudio::NoError and the stateChanged() signal is emitted.

     If a problem occurs during this process the error() is set to QAudio::OpenError,
     state() is set to QAudio::StoppedState and stateChanged() signal is emitted.

    You will typically connect to the \l{QIODevice::}{readyRead()} signal, and
    read from the device in the slot you connect to. QAudioInput keeps ownership
    of the device.
