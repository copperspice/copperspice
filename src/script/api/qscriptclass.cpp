  \class QScriptClass

  \brief The QScriptClass class provides an interface for defining custom behavior of (a class of) Qt Script objects.

  \ingroup script
  \mainclass

  The QScriptClass class defines an interface for handling various
  aspects of interaction with the Qt Script objects associated with
  the class. Such objects are created by calling
  QScriptEngine::newObject(), passing a pointer to the QScriptClass as
  argument.

  By subclassing QScriptClass, you can define precisely how access to
  properties of the objects that use your class is handled. This
  enables a fully dynamic handling of properties, e.g. it's more
  powerful than QScriptEngine::newQObject(). For example, you can use
  QScriptClass to implement array-type objects (i.e. objects that
  handle the \c{length} property, and properties whose names are valid
  array indexes, in a special way), or to implement a "live"
  (runtime-defined) proxy to an underlying object.

  If you just need to handle access to a set of properties that are
  known at the time an object is created (i.e. "semi-statically"), you
  might consider using QScriptValue::setProperty() to define
  getter/setter functions for the relevant properties, rather than
  subclassing QScriptClass.

  Reimplement queryProperty() to specify which properties are handled
  in a custom way by your script class (i.e. should be
  \bold{delegated} to the QScriptClass), and which properties should
  be handled just like normal Qt Script object properties.

  Reimplement property() and setProperty() to perform the actual
  access (read or write) to the properties that your class
  handles. Additionally, you can reimplement propertyFlags() to
  specify custom flags for your properties.

  Reimplement newIterator() to provide an iterator for objects of your
  custom class. This is only necessary if objects of your class can
  have custom properties that you want to be reported when an object
  is used together with the QScriptValueIterator class, or when an
  object is used in a for-in enumeration statement in a script.

  When implementing custom classes of objects, you typically use
  QScriptValue::setData() to store instance-specific data as part of
  object initialization; the data won't be accessible from scripts
  directly, but you can access it in e.g. your reimplementations of
  property() and setProperty() (by calling QScriptValue::data()) to
  perform custom processing.

  Reimplement prototype() to provide a custom prototype object for
  your script class.

  Reimplement supportsExtension() and extension() if your custom
  script class supports one or more of the extensions specified by the
  Extension enum.

/*!
  Queries this script class for how access to the property with the
  given \a name of the given \a object should be handled. The given \a
  flags specify the aspects of interest. This function should return a
  subset of \a flags to indicate which aspects of property access
  should be further handled by the script class.

  For example, if the \a flags contain HandlesReadAccess, and you
  would like your class to handle the reading of the property (through
  the property() function), the returned flags should include
  HandlesReadAccess. If the returned flags do not contain
  HandlesReadAccess, the property will be handled as a normal script
  object property.

  You can optionally use the \a id argument to store a value that will
  subsequently be passed on to functions such as property() and
  setProperty().

  The default implementation of this function returns 0.

  Note: This function is only called if the given property isn't
  already a normal property of the object. For example, say you
  advertise that you want to handle read access to property \c{foo},
  but not write access; if \c{foo} is then assigned a value, it will
  become a normal script object property, and subsequently you will no
  longer be queried regarding read access to \c{foo}.

  This virtual function can be reimplemented in a QScriptClass

  to check if an extension is supported by the QScriptClass.  By
  default, no extensions are supported, and this function returns an
  invalid QVariant.

  If you implement the Callable extension, Qt Script will call this
  function when an instance of your class is called as a function
  (e.g. from a script or using QScriptValue::call()).  The \a argument
  will contain a pointer to the QScriptContext that represents the
  function call, and you should return a QVariant that holds the
  result of the function call. In the following example the sum of the
  arguments to the script function are added up and returned:

  If you implement the HasInstance extension, Qt Script will call this
  function as part of evaluating the \c{instanceof} operator, as
  described in ECMA-262 Section 11.8.6. The \a argument is a
  QScriptValueList containing two items: The first item is the object
  that HasInstance is being applied to (an instance of your class),
  and the second item can be any value. extension() should return true
  if the value delegates behavior to the object, false otherwise.
