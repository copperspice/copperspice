    \class QImageIOHandler
    \brief The QImageIOHandler class defines the common image I/O
    interface for all image formats in Qt.
    \reentrant

    Qt uses QImageIOHandler for reading and writing images through
    QImageReader and QImageWriter. You can also derive from this class
    to write your own image format handler using Qt's plugin mechanism.

    Call setDevice() to assign a device to the handler, and
    setFormat() to assign a format to it. One QImageIOHandler may
    support more than one image format. canRead() returns true if an
    image can be read from the device, and read() and write() return
    true if reading or writing an image was completed successfully.

    QImageIOHandler also has support for animations formats, through
    the functions loopCount(), imageCount(), nextImageDelay() and
    currentImageNumber().

    In order to determine what options an image handler supports, Qt
    will call supportsOption() and setOption(). Make sure to
    reimplement these functions if you can provide support for any of
    the options in the ImageOption enum.

    To write your own image handler, you must at least reimplement
    canRead() and read(). Then create a QImageIOPlugin that
    can create the handler. Finally, install your plugin, and
    QImageReader and QImageWriter will then automatically load the
    plugin, and start using it.

    \sa QImageIOPlugin, QImageReader, QImageWriter
*/

/*! \enum QImageIOHandler::ImageOption

    This enum describes the different options supported by
    QImageIOHandler.  Some options are used to query an image for
    properties, and others are used to toggle the way in which an
    image should be written.

    \value Size The original size of an image. A handler that supports
    this option is expected to read the size of the image from the
    image metadata, and return this size from option() as a QSize.

    \value ClipRect The clip rect, or ROI (Region Of Interest). A
    handler that supports this option is expected to only read the
    provided QRect area from the original image in read(), before any
    other transformation is applied.

    \value ScaledSize The scaled size of the image. A handler that
    supports this option is expected to scale the image to the
    provided size (a QSize), after applying any clip rect
    transformation (ClipRect). If the handler does not support this
    option, QImageReader will perform the scaling after the image has
    been read.

    \value ScaledClipRect The scaled clip rect (or ROI, Region Of
    Interest) of the image. A handler that supports this option is
    expected to apply the provided clip rect (a QRect), after applying
    any scaling (ScaleSize) or regular clipping (ClipRect). If the
    handler does not support this option, QImageReader will apply the
    scaled clip rect after the image has been read.

    \value Description The image description. Some image formats,
    such as GIF and PNG, allow embedding of text
    or comments into the image data (e.g., for storing copyright
    information). It's common that the text is stored in key-value
    pairs, but some formats store all text in one continuous block.
    QImageIOHandler returns the text as one
    QString, where keys and values are separated by a ':', and
    keys-value pairs are separated by two newlines (\\n\\n). For example,
    "Title: Sunset\\n\\nAuthor: Jim Smith\\nSarah Jones\\n\\n". Formats that
    store text in a single block can use "Description" as the key.

    \value CompressionRatio The compression ratio of the image data. A
    handler that supports this option is expected to set its
    compression rate depending on the value of this option (an int)
    when writing.

    \value Gamma The gamma level of the image. A handler that supports
    this option is expected to set the image gamma level depending on
    the value of this option (a float) when writing.

    \value Quality The quality level of the image. A handler that
    supports this option is expected to set the image quality level
    depending on the value of this option (an int) when writing.

    \value Name The name of the image. A handler that supports this
    option is expected to read the name from the image metadata and
    return this as a QString, or when writing an image it is expected
    to store the name in the image metadata.

    \value SubType The subtype of the image. A handler that supports
    this option can use the subtype value to help when reading and
    writing images. For example, a PPM handler may have a subtype
    value of "ppm" or "ppmraw".

    \value IncrementalReading A handler that supports this option is
    expected to read the image in several passes, as if it was an
    animation. QImageReader will treat the image as an animation.

    \value Endianness The endianness of the image. Certain image
    formats can be stored as BigEndian or LittleEndian. A handler that
    supports Endianness uses the value of this option to determine how
    the image should be stored.

    \value Animation Image formats that support animation return
    true for this value in supportsOption(); otherwise, false is returned.

    \value BackgroundColor Certain image formats allow the
    background color to be specified. A handler that supports
    BackgroundColor initializes the background color to this option
    (a QColor) when reading an image.

    \value ImageFormat The image's data format returned by the handler.
    This can be any of the formats listed in QImage::Format.

/*!
    \class QImageIOPlugin
    \brief The QImageIOPlugin class defines an interface for writing
    an image format plugin.
    \reentrant

    \ingroup plugins

    QImageIOPlugin is a factory for creating QImageIOHandler objects,
    which are used internally by QImageReader and QImageWriter to add
    support for different image formats to Qt.

    Writing an image I/O plugin is achieved by subclassing this
    base class, reimplementing the pure virtual functions capabilities(),
    create(), and keys(), and exporting the class with the
    Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2() macro. See \l{How to Create Qt Plugins} for details.

    An image format plugin can support three capabilities: reading (\l
    CanRead), writing (\l CanWrite) and \e incremental reading (\l
    CanReadIncremental). Reimplement capabilities() in you subclass to
    expose the capabilities of your image format.

    create() should create an instance of your QImageIOHandler
    subclass, with the provided device and format properly set, and
    return this handler. You must also reimplement keys() so that Qt
    knows which image formats your plugin supports.

    Different plugins can support different capabilities. For example,
    you may have one plugin that supports reading the GIF format, and
    another that supports writing. Qt will select the correct plugin
    for the job, depending on the return value of capabilities(). If
    several plugins support the same capability, Qt will select one
    arbitrarily.
