    \class QMouseEvent
    \ingroup events

    \brief The QMouseEvent class contains parameters that describe a mouse event.

    Mouse events occur when a mouse button is pressed or released
    inside a widget, or when the mouse cursor is moved.

    Mouse move events will occur only when a mouse button is pressed
    down, unless mouse tracking has been enabled with
    QWidget::setMouseTracking().

    Qt automatically grabs the mouse when a mouse button is pressed
    inside a widget; the widget will continue to receive mouse events
    until the last mouse button is released.

    A mouse event contains a special accept flag that indicates
    whether the receiver wants the event. You should call ignore() if
    the mouse event is not handled by your widget. A mouse event is
    propagated up the parent widget chain until a widget accepts it
    with accept(), or an event filter consumes it.

    \note If a mouse event is propagated to a \l{QWidget}{widget} for
    which Qt::WA_NoMousePropagation has been set, that mouse event
    will not be propagated further up the parent widget chain.

    The state of the keyboard modifier keys can be found by calling the
    \l{QInputEvent::modifiers()}{modifiers()} function, inherited from
    QInputEvent.

    The functions pos(), x(), and y() give the cursor position
    relative to the widget that receives the mouse event. If you
    move the widget as a result of the mouse event, use the global
    position returned by globalPos() to avoid a shaking motion.

    The QWidget::setEnabled() function can be used to enable or
    disable mouse and keyboard events for a widget.

    Reimplement the QWidget event handlers, QWidget::mousePressEvent(),
    QWidget::mouseReleaseEvent(), QWidget::mouseDoubleClickEvent(),
    and QWidget::mouseMoveEvent() to receive mouse events in your own
    widgets.

    \class QHoverEvent
    \ingroup events

    \brief The QHoverEvent class contains parameters that describe a mouse event.

    Mouse events occur when a mouse cursor is moved into, out of, or within a
    widget, and if the widget has the Qt::WA_Hover attribute.

    The function pos() gives the current cursor position, while oldPos() gives
    the old mouse position.

    There are a few similarities between the events QEvent::HoverEnter
    and QEvent::HoverLeave, and the events QEvent::Enter and QEvent::Leave.
    However, they are slightly different because we do an update() in the event
    handler of HoverEnter and HoverLeave.

    QEvent::HoverMove is also slightly different from QEvent::MouseMove. Let us
    consider a top-level window A containing a child B which in turn contains a
    child C (all with mouse tracking enabled):

    \image hoverevents.png

    Now, if you move the cursor from the top to the bottom in the middle of A,
    you will get the following QEvent::MouseMove events:

    \list 1
        \o A::MouseMove
        \o B::MouseMove
        \o C::MouseMove
    \endlist

    You will get the same events for QEvent::HoverMove, except that the event
    always propagates to the top-level regardless whether the event is accepted
    or not. It will only stop propagating with the Qt::WA_NoMousePropagation
    attribute.

    In this case the events will occur in the following way:

    \list 1
        \o A::HoverMove
        \o A::HoverMove, B::HoverMove
        \o A::HoverMove, B::HoverMove, C::HoverMove

/*!

    Most mouse types work in steps of 15 degrees, in which case the
    delta value is a multiple of 120; i.e., 120 units * 1/8 = 15 degrees.

    However, some mice have finer-resolution wheels and send delta values
    that are less than 120 units (less than 15 degrees). To support this
    possibility, you can either cumulatively add the delta values from events
    until the value of 120 is reached, then scroll the widget, or you can

    \brief The QPaintEvent class contains event parameters for paint events.

    \ingroup events

    Paint events are sent to widgets that need to update themselves,
    for instance when part of a widget is exposed because a covering
    widget was moved.

    The event contains a region() that needs to be updated, and a
    rect() that is the bounding rectangle of that region. Both are
    provided because many widgets can't make much use of region(),
    and rect() can be much faster than region().boundingRect().

    \section1 Automatic Clipping

    Painting is clipped to region() during the processing of a paint
    event. This clipping is performed by Qt's paint system and is
    independent of any clipping that may be applied to a QPainter used to
    draw on the paint device.

    As a result, the value returned by QPainter::clipRegion() on
    a newly-constructed QPainter will not reflect the clip region that is
    used by the paint system.

    \class QCloseEvent
    \brief The QCloseEvent class contains parameters that describe a close event.

    \ingroup events

    Close events are sent to widgets that the user wants to close,
    usually by choosing "Close" from the window menu, or by clicking
    the \gui{X} title bar button. They are also sent when you call
    QWidget::close() to close a widget programmatically.

    Close events contain a flag that indicates whether the receiver
    wants the widget to be closed or not. When a widget accepts the
    close event, it is hidden (and destroyed if it was created with
    the Qt::WA_DeleteOnClose flag). If it refuses to accept the close
    event nothing happens. (Under X11 it is possible that the window
    manager will forcibly close the window; but at the time of writing
    we are not aware of any window manager that does this.)

    The event handler QWidget::closeEvent() receives close events. The
    default implementation of this event handler accepts the close
    event. If you do not want your widget to be hidden, or want some
    special handing, you should reimplement the event handler and
    ignore() the event.

    The \l{mainwindows/application#close event handler}{closeEvent() in the
    Application example} shows a close event handler that
    asks whether to save a document before closing.

    If you want the widget to be deleted when it is closed, create it
    with the Qt::WA_DeleteOnClose flag. This is very useful for
    independent top-level windows in a multi-window application.

    \l{QObject}s emits the \l{QObject::destroyed()}{destroyed()}
    signal when they are deleted.

    If the last top-level window is closed, the
    QApplication::lastWindowClosed() signal is emitted.

    The isAccepted() function returns true if the event's receiver has
    agreed to close the widget; call accept() to agree to close the
    widget and call ignore() if the receiver of this event does not
    want the widget to be closed.

/*!
    \class QInputMethodEvent
    \brief The QInputMethodEvent class provides parameters for input method events.

    \ingroup events

    Input method events are sent to widgets when an input method is
    used to enter text into a widget. Input methods are widely used
    to enter text for languages with non-Latin alphabets.

    Note that when creating custom text editing widgets, the
    Qt::WA_InputMethodEnabled window attribute must be set explicitly
    (using the QWidget::setAttribute() function) in order to receive
    input method events.

    The events are of interest to authors of keyboard entry widgets
    who want to be able to correctly handle languages with complex
    character input. Text input in such languages is usually a three
    step process:

    \list 1
    \o \bold{Starting to Compose}

       When the user presses the first key on a keyboard, an input
       context is created. This input context will contain a string
       of the typed characters.

    \o \bold{Composing}

       With every new key pressed, the input method will try to create a
       matching string for the text typed so far called preedit
       string. While the input context is active, the user can only move
       the cursor inside the string belonging to this input context.

    \o \bold{Completing}

       At some point, the user will activate a user interface component
       (perhaps using a particular key) where they can choose from a
       number of strings matching the text they have typed so far. The
       user can either confirm their choice cancel the input; in either
       case the input context will be closed.
    \endlist

    QInputMethodEvent models these three stages, and transfers the
    information needed to correctly render the intermediate result. A
    QInputMethodEvent has two main parameters: preeditString() and
    commitString(). The preeditString() parameter gives the currently
    active preedit string. The commitString() parameter gives a text
    that should get added to (or replace parts of) the text of the
    editor widget. It usually is a result of the input operations and
    has to be inserted to the widgets text directly before the preedit
    string.

    If the commitString() should replace parts of the of the text in
    the editor, replacementLength() will contain the number of
    characters to be replaced. replacementStart() contains the position
    at which characters are to be replaced relative from the start of
    the preedit string.

    A number of attributes control the visual appearance of the
    preedit string (the visual appearance of text outside the preedit
    string is controlled by the widget only). The AttributeType enum
    describes the different attributes that can be set.

    A class implementing QWidget::inputMethodEvent() or
    QGraphicsItem::inputMethodEvent() should at least understand and
    honor the \l TextFormat and \l Cursor attributes.

    Since input methods need to be able to query certain properties
    from the widget or graphics item, subclasses must also implement
    QWidget::inputMethodQuery() and QGraphicsItem::inputMethodQuery(),
    respectively.

    When receiving an input method event, the text widget has to performs the
    following steps:

    \list 1
    \o If the widget has selected text, the selected text should get
       removed.

    \o Remove the text starting at replacementStart() with length
       replacementLength() and replace it by the commitString(). If
       replacementLength() is 0, replacementStart() gives the insertion
       position for the commitString().

       When doing replacement the area of the preedit
       string is ignored, thus a replacement starting at -1 with a length
       of 2 will remove the last character before the preedit string and
       the first character afterwards, and insert the commit string
       directly before the preedit string.

       If the widget implements undo/redo, this operation gets added to
       the undo stack.

    \o If there is no current preedit string, insert the
       preeditString() at the current cursor position; otherwise replace
       the previous preeditString with the one received from this event.

       If the widget implements undo/redo, the preeditString() should not
       influence the undo/redo stack in any way.

       The widget should examine the list of attributes to apply to the
       preedit string. It has to understand at least the TextFormat and
       Cursor attributes and render them as specified.
    \endlist

*/

/*!
    \enum QInputMethodEvent::AttributeType

    \value TextFormat
    A QTextCharFormat for the part of the preedit string specified by
    start and length. value contains a QVariant of type QTextFormat
    specifying rendering of this part of the preedit string. There
    should be at most one format for every part of the preedit
    string. If several are specified for any character in the string the
    behaviour is undefined. A conforming implementation has to at least
    honor the backgroundColor, textColor and fontUnderline properties
    of the format.

    \value Cursor If set, a cursor should be shown inside the preedit
    string at position start. The length variable determines whether
    the cursor is visible or not. If the length is 0 the cursor is
    invisible. If value is a QVariant of type QColor this color will
    be used for rendering the cursor, otherwise the color of the
    surrounding text will be used. There should be at most one Cursor
    attribute per event. If several are specified the behaviour is
    undefined.

    \value Language
    The variant contains a QLocale object specifying the language of a
    certain part of the preedit string. There should be at most one
    language set for every part of the preedit string. If several are
    specified for any character in the string the behavior is undefined.

    \value Ruby
    The ruby text for a part of the preedit string. There should be at
    most one ruby text set for every part of the preedit string. If
    several are specified for any character in the string the behaviour
    is undefined.

    \value Selection
    If set, the edit cursor should be moved to the specified position
    in the editor text contents. In contrast with \c Cursor, this
    attribute does not work on the preedit text, but on the surrounding
    text. The cursor will be moved after the commit string has been
    committed, and the preedit string will be located at the new edit
    position.
    The start position specifies the new position and the length
    variable can be used to set a selection starting from that point.

/*!
    \class QTabletEvent
    \brief The QTabletEvent class contains parameters that describe a Tablet event.

    \ingroup events

    Tablet Events are generated from a Wacom tablet. Most of the time you will
    want to deal with events from the tablet as if they were events from a
    mouse; for example, you would retrieve the cursor position with x(), y(),
    pos(), globalX(), globalY(), and globalPos(). In some situations you may
    wish to retrieve the extra information provided by the tablet device
    driver; for example, you might want to do subpixeling with higher
    resolution coordinates or you may want to adjust color brightness based on
    pressure.  QTabletEvent allows you to read the pressure(), the xTilt(), and
    yTilt(), as well as the type of device being used with device() (see
    \l{TabletDevice}). It can also give you the minimum and maximum values for
    each device's pressure and high resolution coordinates.

    A tablet event contains a special accept flag that indicates whether the
    receiver wants the event. You should call QTabletEvent::accept() if you
    handle the tablet event; otherwise it will be sent to the parent widget.
    The exception are TabletEnterProximity and TabletLeaveProximity events,
    these are only sent to QApplication and don't check whether or not they are
    accepted.

    The QWidget::setEnabled() function can be used to enable or
    disable mouse and keyboard events for a widget.

    The event handler QWidget::tabletEvent() receives all three types of
    tablet events. Qt will first send a tabletEvent then, if it is not
    accepted, it will send a mouse event. This allows applications that
    don't utilize tablets to use a tablet like a mouse, while also
    enabling those who want to use both tablets and mouses differently.

    \section1 Notes for X11 Users

    Qt uses the following hard-coded names to identify tablet
    devices from the xorg.conf file on X11 (apart from IRIX):
    'stylus', 'pen', and 'eraser'. If the devices have other names,
    they will not be picked up Qt.

    \class QDropEvent
    \ingroup events
    \ingroup draganddrop

    \brief The QDropEvent class provides an event which is sent when a
    drag and drop action is completed.

    When a widget \l{QWidget::setAcceptDrops()}{accepts drop events}, it will
    receive this event if it has accepted the most recent QDragEnterEvent or
    QDragMoveEvent sent to it.

    The drop event contains a proposed action, available from proposedAction(), for
    the widget to either accept or ignore. If the action can be handled by the
    widget, you should call the acceptProposedAction() function. Since the
    proposed action can be a combination of \l Qt::DropAction values, it may be
    useful to either select one of these values as a default action or ask
    the user to select their preferred action.

    If the proposed drop action is not suitable, perhaps because your custom
    widget does not support that action, you can replace it with any of the
    \l{possibleActions()}{possible drop actions} by calling setDropAction()
    with your preferred action. If you set a value that is not present in the
    bitwise OR combination of values returned by possibleActions(), the default
    copy action will be used. Once a replacement drop action has been set, call
    accept() instead of acceptProposedAction() to complete the drop operation.

    The mimeData() function provides the data dropped on the widget in a QMimeData
    object. This contains information about the MIME type of the data in addition to
    the data itself.

    Status tips can be set on a widget using the
    QWidget::setStatusTip() function.  They are shown in the status
    bar when the mouse cursor enters the widget. For example:

    \table 100%
    \row

    \dots
    \snippet doc/src/snippets/qstatustipevent/main.cpp 3

    Status tips can also be set on actions using the
    QAction::setStatusTip() function:

    \table 100%

    \section1 Enabling Touch Events

    Touch events occur when pressing, releasing, or moving one or more touch points on a touch
    device (such as a touch-screen or track-pad). To receive touch events, widgets have to have the
    Qt::WA_AcceptTouchEvents attribute set and graphics items need to have the
    \l{QGraphicsItem::setAcceptTouchEvents()}{acceptTouchEvents} attribute set to true.

    When using QAbstractScrollArea based widgets, you should enable the Qt::WA_AcceptTouchEvents
    attribute on the scroll area's \l{QAbstractScrollArea::viewport()}{viewport}.

    Similarly to QMouseEvent, Qt automatically grabs each touch point on the first press inside a
    widget, and the widget will receive all updates for the touch point until it is released.
    Note that it is possible for a widget to receive events for numerous touch points, and that
    multiple widgets may be receiving touch events at the same time.

    \section1 Event Handling

    All touch events are of type QEvent::TouchBegin, QEvent::TouchUpdate, or QEvent::TouchEnd.
    Reimplement QWidget::event() or QAbstractScrollArea::viewportEvent() for widgets and
    QGraphicsItem::sceneEvent() for items in a graphics view to receive touch events.

    The QEvent::TouchUpdate and QEvent::TouchEnd events are sent to the widget or item that
    accepted the QEvent::TouchBegin event. If the QEvent::TouchBegin event is not accepted and not
    filtered by an event filter, then no further touch events are sent until the next
    QEvent::TouchBegin.

    The touchPoints() function returns a list of all touch points contained in the event.
    Information about each touch point can be retrieved using the QTouchEvent::TouchPoint class.
    The Qt::TouchPointState enum describes the different states that a touch point may have.

    \section1 Event Delivery and Propagation

    By default, QWidget::event() translates the first non-primary touch point in a QTouchEvent into
    a QMouseEvent. This makes it possible to enable touch events on existing widgets that do not
    normally handle QTouchEvent. See below for information on some special considerations needed
    when doing this.

    QEvent::TouchBegin is the first touch event sent to a widget. The QEvent::TouchBegin event
    contains a special accept flag that indicates whether the receiver wants the event. By default,
    the event is accepted. You should call ignore() if the touch event is not handled by your
    widget. The QEvent::TouchBegin event is propagated up the parent widget chain until a widget
    accepts it with accept(), or an event filter consumes it. For QGraphicsItems, the
    QEvent::TouchBegin event is propagated to items under the mouse (similar to mouse event
    propagation for QGraphicsItems).

    \section1 Touch Point Grouping

    As mentioned above, it is possible that several widgets can be receiving QTouchEvents at the
    same time. However, Qt makes sure to never send duplicate QEvent::TouchBegin events to the same
    widget, which could theoretically happen during propagation if, for example, the user touched 2
    separate widgets in a QGroupBox and both widgets ignored the QEvent::TouchBegin event.

    To avoid this, Qt will group new touch points together using the following rules:

    \list

    \i When the first touch point is detected, the destination widget is determined firstly by the
    location on screen and secondly by the propagation rules.

    \i When additional touch points are detected, Qt first looks to see if there are any active
    touch points on any ancestor or descendent of the widget under the new touch point. If there
    are, the new touch point is grouped with the first, and the new touch point will be sent in a
    single QTouchEvent to the widget that handled the first touch point. (The widget under the new
    touch point will not receive an event).

    \endlist

    This makes it possible for sibling widgets to handle touch events independently while making
    sure that the sequence of QTouchEvents is always correct.

    \section1 Mouse Events and the Primary Touch Point

    QTouchEvent delivery is independent from that of QMouseEvent. On some windowing systems, mouse
    events are also sent for the \l{QTouchEvent::TouchPoint::isPrimary()}{primary touch point}.
    This means it is possible for your widget to receive both QTouchEvent and QMouseEvent for the
    same user interaction point. You can use the QTouchEvent::TouchPoint::isPrimary() function to
    identify the primary touch point.

    Note that on some systems, it is possible to receive touch events without a primary touch
    point. All this means is that there will be no mouse event generated for the touch points in
    the QTouchEvent.

    \section1 Caveats

    \list

    \i As mentioned above, enabling touch events means multiple widgets can be receiving touch
    events simultaneously. Combined with the default QWidget::event() handling for QTouchEvents,
    this gives you great flexibility in designing touch user interfaces. Be aware of the
    implications. For example, it is possible that the user is moving a QSlider with one finger and
    pressing a QPushButton with another. The signals emitted by these widgets will be
    interleaved.

    \i Recursion into the event loop using one of the exec() methods (e.g., QDialog::exec() or
    QMenu::exec()) in a QTouchEvent event handler is not supported. Since there are multiple event
    recipients, recursion may cause problems, including but not limited to lost events
    and unexpected infinite recursion.

    \i QTouchEvents are not affected by a \l{QWidget::grabMouse()}{mouse grab} or an
    \l{QApplication::activePopupWidget()}{active pop-up widget}. The behavior of QTouchEvents is
    undefined when opening a pop-up or grabbing the mouse while there are more than one active touch
    points.

    \value TouchScreen In this type of device, the touch surface and display are integrated. This
                       means the surface and display typically have the same size, such that there
                       is a direct relationship between the touch points' physical positions and the
                       coordinate reported by QTouchEvent::TouchPoint. As a result, Qt allows the
                       user to interact directly with multiple QWidgets and QGraphicsItems at the
                       same time.

    \value TouchPad In this type of device, the touch surface is separate from the display. There
                    is not a direct relationship between the physical touch location and the
                    on-screen coordinates. Instead, they are calculated relative to the current
                    mouse position, and the user must use the touch-pad to move this reference
                    point. Unlike touch-screens, Qt allows users to only interact with a single
                    QWidget or QGraphicsItem at a time.

    \brief The QGestureEvent class provides the description of triggered gestures.

    The QGestureEvent class contains a list of gestures, which can be obtained using the
    gestures() function.

    The gestures are either active or canceled. A list of those that are currently being
    executed can be obtained using the activeGestures() function. A list of those which
    were previously active and have been canceled can be accessed using the
    canceledGestures() function. A gesture might be canceled if the current window loses
    focus, for example, or because of a timeout, or for other reasons.

    If the event handler does not accept the event by calling the generic
    QEvent::accept() function, all individual QGesture object that were not
    accepted and in the Qt::GestureStarted state will be propagated up the
    parent widget chain until a widget accepts them individually, by calling
    QGestureEvent::accept() for each of them, or an event filter consumes the
    event.
