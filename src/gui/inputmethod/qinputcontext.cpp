/*!
    This function can be reimplemented in a subclass to filter input
    events.

    Return true if the \a event has been consumed. Otherwise, the
    unfiltered \a event will be forwarded to widgets as ordinary
    way. Although the input events have accept() and ignore()
    methods, leave it untouched.

    \a event is currently restricted to events of these types:

    \list
        \i CloseSoftwareInputPanel
        \i KeyPress
        \i KeyRelease
        \i MouseButtonDblClick
        \i MouseButtonPress
        \i MouseButtonRelease
        \i MouseMove
        \i RequestSoftwareInputPanel
    \endlist

    But some input method related events such as QWheelEvent or
    QTabletEvent may be added in future.

    The filtering opportunity is always given to the input context as
    soon as possible. It has to be taken place before any other key
    event consumers such as eventfilters and accelerators because some
    input methods require quite various key combination and
    sequences. It often conflicts with accelerators and so on, so we
    must give the input context the filtering opportunity first to
    ensure all input methods work properly regardless of application
    design.

    Ordinary input methods require discrete key events to work
    properly, so Qt's key compression is always disabled for any input
    contexts.

  widget. Implementations of QInputContext should call this method to
  send the generated input method events and not
  QApplication::sendEvent(), as the events might have to get dispatched
  to a different application on some platforms.

  Some complex input methods route the handling to several child
  contexts (e.g. to enable language switching). To account for this,
  QInputContext will check if the parent object is a QInputContext. If
  yes, it will call the parents sendEvent() implementation instead of
  sending the event directly.

    widget. The event type is QEvent::MouseButtonPress,

    This function is called by several widgets to reset input
    state. For example, a text widget call this function before
    inserting a text to make widget ready to accept a text.

    Default implementation is sufficient for simple input method. You
    can override this function to reset external input method engines
    in complex input method. In the case, call QInputContext::reset()
    to ensure proper termination of inputting.

    In a reimplementation of reset(), you must not send any
    QInputMethodEvent containing preedit text. You can only commit
    string and attributes; otherwise, you risk breaking input state
    consistency.

    consist of ASCII characters only.

    of the input context. If the input context can handle multiple
    languages, return the currently used one. The name has to be
    consistent with QInputContextPlugin::language().

    This information will be used by language tagging feature in
    QInputMethodEvent. It is required to distinguish unified han characters
