/*!
  The destructor destroys the QSystemSemaphore object, but the
  underlying system semaphore is not removed from the system unless
  this instance of QSystemSemaphore is the last one existing for that
  system semaphore.

  Two important side effects of the destructor depend on the system.
  In Windows, if acquire() has been called for this semaphore but not
  release(), release() will not be called by the destructor, nor will
  the resource be released when the process exits normally. This would
  be a program bug which could be the cause of a deadlock in another
  process trying to acquire the same resource. In Unix, acquired
  resources that are not released before the destructor is called are
  automatically released when the process exits.

/*!
  \enum QSystemSemaphore::AccessMode

  This enum is used by the constructor and setKey(). Its purpose is to
  enable handling the problem in Unix implementations of semaphores
  that survive a crash. In Unix, when a semaphore survives a crash, we
  need a way to force it to reset its resource count, when the system
  reuses the semaphore. In Windows and in Symbian, where semaphores can't survive a
  crash, this enum has no effect.

  \value Open If the semaphore already exists, its initial resource
  count is not reset. If the semaphore does not already exist, it is
  created and its initial resource count set.

  \value Create QSystemSemaphore takes ownership of the semaphore and
  sets its resource count to the requested value, regardless of
  whether the semaphore already exists by having survived a crash.
  This value should be passed to the constructor, when the first
  semaphore for a particular key is constructed and you know that if
  the semaphore already exists it could only be because of a crash. In
  Windows and in Symbian, where a semaphore can't survive a crash, Create and Open
  have the same behavior.
