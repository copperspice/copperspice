/*
    The purpose of this file is to stub out certain functions
    that are not provided by the Native Client SDK. This is
    done as an alterative to sprinkling the Qt sources with
    NACL ifdefs.

    There are two main classes of functions:

    - Functions that are called but can have no effect:
    For these we simply give an empty implementation

    - Functions that are referenced in the source code, but
    is not/must not be called at run-time:
    These we either leave undefined or implement with a
    qFatal.

    This is a work in progress.
