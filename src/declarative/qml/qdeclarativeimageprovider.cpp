    \class QDeclarativeImageProvider
    \since 4.7
    \brief The QDeclarativeImageProvider class provides an interface for supporting pixmaps and threaded image requests in QML.

    QDeclarativeImageProvider is used to provide advanced image loading features
    in QML applications. It allows images in QML to be:

    \list
    \o Loaded using QPixmaps rather than actual image files
    \o Loaded asynchronously in a separate thread, if imageType() is \l{QDeclarativeImageProvider::ImageType}{ImageType::Image}
    \endlist

    To specify that an image should be loaded by an image provider, use the
    \bold {"image:"} scheme for the URL source of the image, followed by the
    identifiers of the image provider and the requested image. For example:

    \qml
    Image { source: "image://myimageprovider/image.png" }
    \endqml

    This specifies that the image should be loaded by the image provider named
    "myimageprovider", and the image to be loaded is named "image.png". The QML engine
    invokes the appropriate image provider according to the providers that have
    been registered through QDeclarativeEngine::addImageProvider().

    Note that the identifiers are case-insensitive, but the rest of the URL will be passed on with
    preserved case. For example, the below snippet would still specify that the image is loaded by the
    image provider named "myimageprovider", but it would request a different image than the above snippet
    ("Image.png" instead of "image.png").
    \qml
    Image { source: "image://MyImageProvider/Image.png" }
    \endqml

    If you want the rest of the URL to be case insensitive, you will have to take care
    of that yourself inside your image provider.

    \section2 An example

    Here are two images. Their \c source values indicate they should be loaded by
    an image provider named "colors", and the images to be loaded are "yellow"
    and "red", respectively:

    \snippet examples/declarative/cppextensions/imageprovider/imageprovider-example.qml 0

    When these images are loaded by QML, it looks for a matching image provider
    and calls its requestImage() or requestPixmap() method (depending on its
    imageType()) to load the image. The method is called with the \c id
    parameter set to "yellow" for the first image, and "red" for the second.

    Here is an image provider implementation that can load the images
    requested by the above QML. This implementation dynamically
    generates QPixmap images that are filled with the requested color:

    \snippet examples/declarative/cppextensions/imageprovider/imageprovider.cpp 0
    \codeline
    \snippet examples/declarative/cppextensions/imageprovider/imageprovider.cpp 1

    To make this provider accessible to QML, it is registered with the QML engine
    with a "colors" identifier:

    \code
    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        ...

        QDeclarativeEngine engine;
        engine->addImageProvider(QLatin1String("colors"), new ColorPixmapProvider);

        ...
    }
    \endcode

    Now the images can be successfully loaded in QML:

    \image imageprovider.png

    A complete example is available in Qt's
    \l {declarative/cppextensions/imageprovider}{examples/declarative/cppextensions/imageprovider}
    directory. Note the example registers the provider via a \l{QDeclarativeExtensionPlugin}{plugin}
    instead of registering it in the application \c main() function as shown above.


    \section2 Asynchronous image loading

    Image providers that support QImage loading automatically include support
    for asychronous loading of images. To enable asynchronous loading for an
    image source, set the \c asynchronous property to \c true for the relevant
    \l Image, \l BorderImage or \l AnimatedImage object. When this is enabled,
    the image request to the provider is run in a low priority thread,
    allowing image loading to be executed in the background, and reducing the
    performance impact on the user interface.

    Asynchronous loading is not supported for image providers that provide
    QPixmap rather than QImage values, as pixmaps can only be created in the
    main thread. In this case, if \l {Image::}{asynchronous} is set to
    \c true, the value is ignored and the image is loaded
    synchronously.


    \section2 Image caching

    Images returned by a QDeclarativeImageProvider are automatically cached,
    similar to any image loaded by the QML engine. When an image with a
    "image://" prefix is loaded from cache, requestImage() and requestPixmap()
    will not be called for the relevant image provider. If an image should always
    be fetched from the image provider, and should not be cached at all, set the
    \c cache property to \c false for the relevant \l Image, \l BorderImage or
    \l AnimatedImage object.
