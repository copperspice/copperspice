    \class QDeclarativeNetworkAccessManagerFactory
    \since 4.7
    \brief The QDeclarativeNetworkAccessManagerFactory class creates QNetworkAccessManager instances for a QML engine.

    A QML engine uses QNetworkAccessManager for all network access.
    By implementing a factory, it is possible to provide the QML engine
    with custom QNetworkAccessManager instances with specialized caching,
    proxy and cookies support.

    To implement a factory, subclass QDeclarativeNetworkAccessManagerFactory and
    implement the virtual create() method, then assign it to the relevant QML
    engine using QDeclarativeEngine::setNetworkAccessManagerFactory().

    Note the QML engine may create QNetworkAccessManager instances
    from multiple threads. Because of this, the implementation of the create()
    method must be \l{Reentrancy and Thread-Safety}{reentrant}. In addition,
    the developer should be careful if the signals of the object to be
    returned from create() are connected to the slots of an object that may
    be created in a different thread:

    \list
    \o The QML engine internally handles all requests, and cleans up any
       QNetworkReply objects it creates. Receiving the
       QNetworkAccessManager::finished() signal in another thread may not
       provide the receiver with a valid reply object if it has already
       been deleted.
    \o Authentication details provided to QNetworkAccessManager::authenticationRequired()
       must be provided immediately, so this signal cannot be connected as a
       Qt::QueuedConnection (or as the default Qt::AutoConnection from another
       thread).
    \endlist

    For more information about signals and threads, see
    \l {Threads and QObjects} and \l {Signals and Slots Across Threads}.

    \fn QNetworkAccessManager *QDeclarativeNetworkAccessManagerFactory::create(QObject *parent)

    Creates and returns a network access manager with the specified \a parent.
    This method must return a new QNetworkAccessManager instance each time
    it is called.

    Note: this method may be called by multiple threads, so ensure the
    implementation of this method is reentrant.
