    \class QNetworkReply
    \since 4.4
    \brief The QNetworkReply class contains the data and headers for a request
    sent with QNetworkAccessManager

    \reentrant
    \ingroup network
    \inmodule QtNetwork

    The QNetworkReply class contains the data and meta data related to
    a request posted with QNetworkAccessManager. Like QNetworkRequest,
    it contains a URL and headers (both in parsed and raw form), some
    information about the reply's state and the contents of the reply
    itself.

    QNetworkReply is a sequential-access QIODevice, which means that
    once data is read from the object, it no longer kept by the
    device. It is therefore the application's responsibility to keep
    this data if it needs to. Whenever more data is received from the
    network and processed, the readyRead() signal is emitted.

    The downloadProgress() signal is also emitted when data is
    received, but the number of bytes contained in it may not
    represent the actual bytes received, if any transformation is done
    to the contents (for example, decompressing and removing the
    protocol overhead).

    Even though QNetworkReply is a QIODevice connected to the contents
    of the reply, it also emits the uploadProgress() signal, which
    indicates the progress of the upload for operations that have such
    content.

    \note Do not delete the object in the slot connected to the
    error() or finished() signal. Use deleteLater().

    \sa QNetworkRequest, QNetworkAccessManager
*/

/*!
    \enum QNetworkReply::NetworkError

    Indicates all possible error conditions found during the
    processing of the request.

    \value NoError              no error condition.
    \note When the HTTP protocol returns a redirect no error will be
    reported.  You can check if there is a redirect with the
    QNetworkRequest::RedirectionTargetAttribute attribute.

    \value ConnectionRefusedError  the remote server refused the
    connection (the server is not accepting requests)

    \value RemoteHostClosedError   the remote server closed the
    connection prematurely, before the entire reply was received and
    processed

    \value HostNotFoundError       the remote host name was not found
    (invalid hostname)

    \value TimeoutError            the connection to the remote server
    timed out

    \value OperationCanceledError  the operation was canceled via calls
    to abort() or close() before it was finished.

    \value SslHandshakeFailedError the SSL/TLS handshake failed and the
    encrypted channel could not be established. The sslErrors() signal
    should have been emitted.

    \value TemporaryNetworkFailureError the connection was broken due
    to disconnection from the network, however the system has initiated
    roaming to another access point. The request should be resubmitted
    and will be processed as soon as the connection is re-established.

    \value ProxyConnectionRefusedError the connection to the proxy
    server was refused (the proxy server is not accepting requests)

    \value ProxyConnectionClosedError  the proxy server closed the
    connection prematurely, before the entire reply was received and
    processed

    \value ProxyNotFoundError          the proxy host name was not
    found (invalid proxy hostname)

    \value ProxyTimeoutError           the connection to the proxy
    timed out or the proxy did not reply in time to the request sent

    \value ProxyAuthenticationRequiredError the proxy requires
    authentication in order to honour the request but did not accept
    any credentials offered (if any)

    \value ContentAccessDenied          the access to the remote
    content was denied (similar to HTTP error 401)

    \value ContentOperationNotPermittedError the operation requested
    on the remote content is not permitted

    \value ContentNotFoundError         the remote content was not
    found at the server (similar to HTTP error 404)

    \value AuthenticationRequiredError  the remote server requires
    authentication to serve the content but the credentials provided
    were not accepted (if any)

    \value ContentReSendError          the request needed to be sent
    again, but this failed for example because the upload data
    could not be read a second time.

    \value ProtocolUnknownError         the Network Access API cannot
    honor the request because the protocol is not known

    \value ProtocolInvalidOperationError the requested operation is
    invalid for this protocol

    \value UnknownNetworkError          an unknown network-related
    error was detected

    \value UnknownProxyError            an unknown proxy-related error
    was detected

    \value UnknownContentError          an unknown error related to
    the remote content was detected

    \value ProtocolFailure              a breakdown in protocol was
    detected (parsing error, invalid or unexpected responses, etc.)

    \sa error()
*/

/*!
    \fn void QNetworkReply::sslErrors(const QList<QSslError> &errors)

    This signal is emitted if the SSL/TLS session encountered errors
    during the set up, including certificate verification errors. The
    \a errors parameter contains the list of errors.

    To indicate that the errors are not fatal and that the connection
    should proceed, the ignoreSslErrors() function should be called
    from the slot connected to this signal. If it is not called, the
    SSL session will be torn down before any data is exchanged
    (including the URL).

    This signal can be used to display an error message to the user
    indicating that security may be compromised and display the
    SSL settings (see sslConfiguration() to obtain it). If the user
    decides to proceed after analyzing the remote certificate, the
    slot should call ignoreSslErrors().

    \sa QSslSocket::sslErrors(), QNetworkAccessManager::sslErrors(),
    sslConfiguration(), ignoreSslErrors()
*/

/*!
    \fn void QNetworkReply::metaDataChanged()

    \omit FIXME: Update name? \endomit

    This signal is emitted whenever the metadata in this reply
    changes. metadata is any information that is not the content
    (data) itself, including the network headers. In the majority of
    cases, the metadata will be known fully by the time the first
    byte of data is received. However, it is possible to receive
    updates of headers or other metadata during the processing of the
    data.

    \sa header(), rawHeaderList(), rawHeader(), hasRawHeader()
*/

/*!
    \fn void QNetworkReply::finished()

    This signal is emitted when the reply has finished
    processing. After this signal is emitted, there will be no more
    updates to the reply's data or metadata.

    Unless close() has been called, the reply will be still be opened
    for reading, so the data can be retrieved by calls to read() or
    readAll(). In particular, if no calls to read() were made as a
    result of readyRead(), a call to readAll() will retrieve the full
    contents in a QByteArray.

    This signal is emitted in tandem with
    QNetworkAccessManager::finished() where that signal's reply
    parameter is this object.

    \note Do not delete the object in the slot connected to this
    signal. Use deleteLater().

    You can also use isFinished() to check if a QNetworkReply
    has finished even before you receive the finished() signal.

    \sa QNetworkAccessManager::finished(), isFinished()
*/

/*!
    \fn void QNetworkReply::error(QNetworkReply::NetworkError code)

    This signal is emitted when the reply detects an error in
    processing. The finished() signal will probably follow, indicating
    that the connection is over.

    The \a code parameter contains the code of the error that was
    detected. Call errorString() to obtain a textual representation of
    the error condition.

    \note Do not delete the object in the slot connected to this
    signal. Use deleteLater().

    \sa error(), errorString()

/*!
    \fn void QNetworkReply::uploadProgress(qint64 bytesSent, qint64 bytesTotal)

    This signal is emitted to indicate the progress of the upload part
    of this network request, if there's any. If there's no upload
    associated with this request, this signal will not be emitted.

    The \a bytesSent
    parameter indicates the number of bytes uploaded, while \a
    bytesTotal indicates the total number of bytes to be uploaded. If
    the number of bytes to be uploaded could not be determined, \a
    bytesTotal will be -1.

    The upload is finished when \a bytesSent is equal to \a
    bytesTotal. At that time, \a bytesTotal will not be -1.

    \sa downloadProgress()
*/

/*!
    \fn void QNetworkReply::downloadProgress(qint64 bytesReceived, qint64 bytesTotal)

    This signal is emitted to indicate the progress of the download
    part of this network request, if there's any. If there's no
    download associated with this request, this signal will be emitted
    once with 0 as the value of both \a bytesReceived and \a
    bytesTotal.

    The \a bytesReceived parameter indicates the number of bytes
    received, while \a bytesTotal indicates the total number of bytes
    expected to be downloaded. If the number of bytes to be downloaded
    is not known, \a bytesTotal will be -1.

    The download is finished when \a bytesReceived is equal to \a
    bytesTotal. At that time, \a bytesTotal will not be -1.

    Note that the values of both \a bytesReceived and \a bytesTotal
    may be different from size(), the total number of bytes
    obtained through read() or readAll(), or the value of the
    header(ContentLengthHeader). The reason for that is that there may
    be protocol overhead or the data may be compressed during the
    download.
