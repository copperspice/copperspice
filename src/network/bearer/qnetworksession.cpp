    \class QNetworkSession

    \brief The QNetworkSession class provides control over the system's access points
    and enables session management for cases when multiple clients access the same access point.

    \since 4.7

    \inmodule QtNetwork
    \ingroup network

    A QNetworkSession enables control over the system's network interfaces. The session's configuration
    parameter are determined via the QNetworkConfiguration object to which it is bound. Depending on the
    type of the session (single access point or service network) a session may be linked to one or more
    network interfaces. By means of \l{open()}{opening} and \l{close()}{closing} of network sessions
    a developer can start and stop the systems network interfaces. If the configuration represents
    multiple access points (see \l QNetworkConfiguration::ServiceNetwork) more advanced features such as roaming may be supported.

    QNetworkSession supports session management within the same process and depending on the platform's
    capabilities may support out-of-process sessions. If the same
    network configuration is used by multiple open sessions the underlying network interface is only terminated once
    the last session has been closed.

    \section1 Roaming

    Applications may connect to the preferredConfigurationChanged() signal in order to
    receive notifications when a more suitable access point becomes available.
    In response to this signal the application must either initiate the roaming via migrate()
    or ignore() the new access point. Once the session has roamed the
    newConfigurationActivated() signal is emitted. The application may now test the
    carrier and must either accept() or reject() it. The session will return to the previous
    access point if the roaming was rejected. The subsequent state diagram depicts the required
    state transitions.

    \image roaming-states.png

    Some platforms may distinguish forced roaming and application level roaming (ALR).
    ALR implies that the application controls (via migrate(), ignore(), accept() and reject())
    whether a network session can roam from one access point to the next. Such control is useful
    if the application maintains stateful socket connections and wants to control the transition from
    one interface to the next. Forced roaming implies that the system automatically roams to the next network without
    consulting the application. This has the advantage that the application can make use of roaming features
    without actually being aware of it. It is expected that the application detects that the underlying
    socket is broken and automatically reconnects via the new network link.

    If the platform supports both modes of roaming, an application indicates its preference
    by connecting to the preferredConfigurationChanged() signal. Connecting to this signal means that
    the application wants to take control over the roaming behavior and therefore implies application
    level roaming. If the client does not connect to the preferredConfigurationChanged(), forced roaming
    is used. If forced roaming is not supported the network session will not roam by default.

    Some applications may want to suppress any form of roaming altogether. Possible use cases may be
    high priority downloads or remote services which cannot handle a roaming enabled client. Clients
    can suppress roaming by connecting to the preferredConfigurationChanged() signal and answer each
    signal emission with ignore().

    \enum QNetworkSession::State

    This enum describes the connectivity state of the session. If the session is based on a
    single access point configuration the state of the session is the same as the state of the
    associated network interface.

    \value Invalid          The session is invalid due to an invalid configuration. This may
                            happen due to a removed access point or a configuration that was
                            invalid to begin with.
    \value NotAvailable     The session is based on a defined but not yet discovered QNetworkConfiguration
                            (see \l QNetworkConfiguration::StateFlag).
    \value Connecting       The network session is being established.
    \value Connected        The network session is connected. If the current process wishes to use this session
                            it has to register its interest by calling open(). A network session
                            is considered to be ready for socket operations if it isOpen() and connected.
    \value Closing          The network session is in the process of being shut down.
    \value Disconnected     The network session is not connected. The associated QNetworkConfiguration
                            has the state QNetworkConfiguration::Discovered.
    \value Roaming          The network session is roaming from one access point to another
                            access point.

/*!
    \fn void QNetworkSession::preferredConfigurationChanged(const QNetworkConfiguration &config, bool isSeamless)

    This signal is emitted when the preferred configuration/access point for the
    session changes. Only sessions which are based on service network configurations
    may emit this signal. \a config can be used to determine access point specific
    details such as proxy settings and \a isSeamless indicates whether roaming will
    break the sessions IP address.

    As a consequence to this signal the application must either start the roaming process
    by calling migrate() or choose to ignore() the new access point.

    If the roaming process is non-seamless the IP address will change which means that
    a socket becomes invalid. However seamless mobility can ensure that the local IP address
    does not change. This is achieved by using a virtual IP address which is bound to the actual
    link address. During the roaming process the virtual address is attached to the new link
    address.

    Some platforms may support the concept of Forced Roaming and Application Level Roaming (ALR).
    Forced roaming implies that the platform may simply roam to a new configuration without
    consulting applications. It is up to the application to detect the link layer loss and reestablish
    its sockets. In contrast ALR provides the opportunity to prevent the system from roaming.
    If this session is based on a configuration that supports roaming the application can choose
    whether it wants to be consulted (ALR use case) by connecting to this signal. For as long as this signal
    connection remains the session remains registered as a roaming stakeholder; otherwise roaming will
    be enforced by the platform.

    Returns the value for property \a key.

    A network session can have properties attached which may describe the session in more details.
    This function can be used to gain access to those properties.

    The following property keys are guaranteed to be specified on all platforms:

    \table
        \header
            \o Key \o Description
        \row
            \o ActiveConfiguration
            \o If the session \l isOpen() this property returns the identifier of the
            QNetworkConfiguration that is used by this session; otherwise an empty string.

            The main purpose of this key is to determine which Internet access point is used
            if the session is based on a \l{QNetworkConfiguration::ServiceNetwork}{ServiceNetwork}.
            The following code snippet highlights the difference:
            \code
                    QNetworkConfigurationManager mgr;
                    QNetworkConfiguration ap = mgr.defaultConfiguration();
                    QNetworkSession *session = new QNetworkSession(ap);
                    ... //code activates session

                    QString ident = session->sessionProperty("ActiveConfiguration").toString();
                    if ( ap.type() == QNetworkConfiguration::ServiceNetwork ) {
                        Q_ASSERT( ap.identifier() != ident );
                        Q_ASSERT( ap.children().contains( mgr.configurationFromIdentifier(ident) ) );
                    } else if ( ap.type() == QNetworkConfiguration::InternetAccessPoint ) {
                        Q_ASSERT( ap.identifier() == ident );
                    }
                \endcode
        \row
            \o UserChoiceConfiguration
            \o If the session \l isOpen() and is bound to a QNetworkConfiguration of type
            UserChoice, this property returns the identifier of the QNetworkConfiguration that the
            configuration resolved to when \l open() was called; otherwise an empty string.

            The purpose of this key is to determine the real QNetworkConfiguration that the
            session is using. This key is different from \e ActiveConfiguration in that
            this key may return an identifier for either a
            \l {QNetworkConfiguration::ServiceNetwork}{service network} or a
            \l {QNetworkConfiguration::InternetAccessPoint}{Internet access points} configurations,
            whereas \e ActiveConfiguration always returns identifiers to
            \l {QNetworkConfiguration::InternetAccessPoint}{Internet access points} configurations.
        \row
            \o ConnectInBackground
            \o Setting this property to \e true before calling \l open() implies that the connection attempt
            is made but if no connection can be established, the user is not connsulted and asked to select
            a suitable connection. This property is not set by default and support for it depends on the platform.

        \row
            \o AutoCloseSessionTimeout
            \o If the session requires polling to keep its state up to date, this property holds
               the timeout in milliseconds before the session will automatically close. If the
               value of this property is -1 the session will not automatically close. This property
               is set to -1 by default.

               The purpose of this property is to minimize resource use on platforms that use
               polling to update the state of the session. Applications can set the value of this
               property to the desired timeout before the session is closed. In response to the
               closed() signal the network session should be deleted to ensure that all polling is
               stopped. The session can then be recreated once it is required again. This property
               has no effect for sessions that do not require polling.
