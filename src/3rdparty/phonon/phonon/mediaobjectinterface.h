/* \class MediaObjectInterface mediaobjectinterface.h Phonon/MediaObjectInterface
 * \short Backend interface for media sources.
 *
 * The backend implementation has to provide two signals, that are not defined
 * in this interface:
 * <ul>
 * <li>\anchor phonon_MediaObjectInterface_stateChanged
 * <b>void stateChanged(\ref Phonon::State newstate, \ref Phonon::State oldstate)</b>
 *
 * Emitted when the state of the MediaObject has changed.
 * In case you're not interested in the old state you can also
 * connect to a slot that only has one State argument.
 *
 * \param newstate The state the Player is in now.
 * \param oldstate The state the Player was in before.
 * </li>
 * <li>\anchor phonon_MediaObjectInterface_tick
 * <b>void tick(qint64 time)</b>
 *
 * This signal gets emitted every tickInterval milliseconds.
 *
 * \param time The position of the media file in milliseconds.
 *
 * \see setTickInterval()
 * \see tickInterval()
 * </li>
 * </ul>
