/* This is JavaScriptCore's variant of the PCRE library. While this library
started out as a copy of PCRE, many of the features of PCRE have been
removed. This library now supports only the regular expression features
required by the JavaScript language specification, and has only the functions
needed by JavaScriptCore and the rest of WebKit.

/* The data consists of a vector of structures of type cnode. The two unsigned
32-bit integers are used as follows:

(f0) (1) The most significant byte holds the script number. The numbers are
         defined by the enum in ucp.h.

     (2) The 0x00800000 bit is set if this entry defines a range of characters.
         It is not set if this entry defines a single character

     (3) The 0x00600000 bits are spare.

     (4) The 0x001fffff bits contain the code point. No Unicode code point will
         ever be greater than 0x0010ffff, so this should be OK for ever.

(f1) (1) The 0xfc000000 bits contain the character type number. The numbers are
         defined by an enum in ucp.h.

     (2) The 0x03ff0000 bits are spare.

     (3) The 0x0000ffff bits contain EITHER the unsigned offset to the top of
         range if this entry defines a range, OR the *signed* offset to the
         character's "other case" partner if this entry defines a single
         character. There is no partner if the value is zero.

| script (8) |.|.|.| codepoint (21) || type (6) |.|.| spare (8) | offset (16) |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              | | |                              | |

              |
              |-> range flag

The upper/lower casing information is set only for characters that come in
pairs. The non-one-to-one mappings in the Unicode data are ignored.

When searching the data, proceed as follows:

(1) Set up for a binary chop search.

(2) If the top is not greater than the bottom, the character is not in the
    table. Its type must therefore be "Cn" ("Undefined").

(3) Find the middle vector element.

(4) Extract the code point and compare. If equal, we are done.

(5) If the test character is smaller, set the top to the current point, and
    goto (2).

(6) If the current entry defines a range, compute the last character by adding
    the offset, and see if the test character is within the range. If it is,
    we are done.

(7) Otherwise, set the bottom to one element past the current point and goto
    (2).
