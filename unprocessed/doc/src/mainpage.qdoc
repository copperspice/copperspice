\keyword qt-technologies
\section1 Qt Technologies

Qt introduces an innovative alternative for inter-object communication, called
"signals and slots", that replaces the old and unsafe callback technique used in
many legacy frameworks. Qt also provides a conventional event model for handling
mouse clicks, key presses, and other user input. Qt's cross-platform GUI
applications can support all the user interface functionality required by modern
applications, such as menus, context menus, drag and drop, and dockable
toolbars. Desktop integration features provided by Qt can be used to extend
applications into the surrounding desktop environment, taking advantage of some
of the services provided on each platform.

The \l{All Modules}{Qt Modules} page has a listing of the technology modules offered by Qt.
