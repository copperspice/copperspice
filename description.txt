CopperSpice C++ cross platform GUI library
 CopperSpice is a set of individual libraries which can be used to develop
 cross platform software applications in C++. It is a totally open source
 project released under the LGPL V2.1 license and was initially derived 
 from the Qt framework. Over the last several years CopperSpice has 
 completely diverged, with a goal of providing a first class GUI library
 to unite the C++ community.
