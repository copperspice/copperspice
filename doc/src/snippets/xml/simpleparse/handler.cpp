handler.cpp

Provides a handler for processing XML elements found by the reader.

The handler stores the names of elements it finds and their indentation
levels. The indentation level is initially set to zero.
When a starting element is found, the indentation level is increased;
when an ending element is found, the indentation level is decreased.
