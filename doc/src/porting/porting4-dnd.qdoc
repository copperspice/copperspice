    \brief An overview of the porting process for applications that use drag and drop.

    Qt 4 introduces a new set of classes to handle drag and drop operations
    that aim to be easier to use than their counterparts in Qt 3. As a result,
    the way that drag and drop is performed is quite different to the way
    developers of Qt 3 applications have come to expect. In this guide, we
    show the differences between the old and new APIs and indicate where
    applications need to be changed when they are ported to Qt 4.

    \tableofcontents

    \section1 Dragging

    In Qt 3, drag operations are encapsulated by \c QDragObject (see Q3DragObject)
    and its subclasses. These objects are typically constructed on the heap in
    response to mouse click or mouse move events, and ownership of them is
    transferred to Qt so that they can be deleted when the corresponding drag and
    drop operations have been completed. The drag source has no control over how
    the drag and drop operation is performed once the object's
    \l{Q3DragObject::}{drag()} function is called, and it receives no information
    about how the operation ended.

    Similarly, in Qt 4, drag operations are also initiated when a QDrag object
    is constructed and its \l{QDrag::}{exec()} function is called. In contrast,
    these objects are typically constructed on the stack rather than the heap
    since each drag and drop operation is performed synchronously as far as the
    drag source is concerned. One key benefit of this is that the drag source
    can receive information about how the operation ended from the value returned
    by \l{QDrag::}{exec()}.

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/porting4-dropevents/window.cpp 3
    \dots 8
    \snippet doc/src/snippets/porting4-dropevents/window.cpp 4
    \snippet doc/src/snippets/porting4-dropevents/window.cpp 5

    A key difference in the above code is the use of the QMimeData class to hold
    information about the data that is transferred. Qt 3 relies on subclasses
    of \c QDragObject to provide support for specific MIME types; in Qt 4, the
    use of QMimeData as a generic container for data makes the relationship
    between MIME type and data more tranparent. QMimeData is described in more
    detail later in this document.

    \section1 Dropping

    In both Qt 3 and Qt 4, it is possible to prepare a custom widget to accept
    dropped data by enabling the \l{QWidget::}{acceptDrops} property of a widget,
    usually in the widget's constructor. As a result, the widget will receive
    drag enter events that can be handled by its \l{QWidget::}{dragEnterEvent()}
    function.
    As in Qt 3, custom widgets in Qt 4 handle these events by determining
    whether the data supplied by the drag and drop operation can be dropped onto
    the widget. Since the classes used to encapsulate MIME data are different in
    Qt 3 and Qt 4, the exact implementations differ.

    In Qt 3, the drag enter event is handled by checking whether each of the
    standard \c QDragObject subclasses can decode the data supplied, and
    indicating success or failure of these checks via the event's
    \l{QDragEnterEvent::}{accept()} function, as shown in this simple example:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_dnd.cpp 1

    In Qt 4, you can examine the MIME type describing the data to determine
    whether the widget should accept the event or, for common data types, you
    can use convenience functions:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/porting4-dropevents/window.cpp 0

    The widget has some control over the type of drag and drop operation to be
    performed. In the above code, the action proposed by the drag source is
    accepted, but
    \l{Drag and Drop#Overriding Proposed Actions}{this can be overridden} if
    required.

    In both Qt 3 and Qt 4, it is necessary to accept a given drag event in order
    to receive the corresponding drop event. A custom widget in Qt 3 that can
    accept dropped data in the form of text or images might provide an
    implementation of \l{QWidget::}{dropEvent()} that looks like the following:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_dnd.cpp 2

    In Qt 4, the event is handled in a similar way:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/porting4-dropevents/window.cpp 1

    It is also possible to extract data stored for a particular MIME type if it
    was specified by the drag source.

    \section1 MIME Types and Data

    In Qt 3, data to be transferred in drag and drop operations is encapsulated
    in instances of \c QDragObject and its subclasses, representing specific
    data formats related to common MIME type and subtypes.

    In Qt 4, only the QMimeData class is used to represent data, providing a
    container for data stored in multiple formats, each associated with
    a relevant MIME type. Since arbitrary MIME types can be specified, there is
    no need for an extensive class hierarchy to represent different kinds of
    information. Additionally, QMimeData it provides some convenience functions
    to allow the most common data formats to be stored and retrieved with less
    effort than for arbitrary MIME types.
