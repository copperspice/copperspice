CopperSpice is a C++ library derived from the existing Qt 4.8 framework. Our
goal was to change the core design of the libraries, leveraging template
functionality and C++11 capabilities.

The redesign allowed us to completely remove the Qt Meta-Object Compiler (moc)
system. Moc is a code generator and did not support many aspects of C++
including templates, complex data types, static type checking, and relies
heavily on string comparisons. Removing moc improves run time performance,
reduces the complexity of the build process, and allows more issues to be
detected at compile time.

CopperSpice library key features:

 * The CopperSpice libraries are a fork of Nokia LGPL Qt 4.8.2
 * New classes and methods have been added which exceed what is available in
   Qt 4 or Qt 5
 * Qt Meta-Object Compiler (moc) is fully obsolete
 * Our libraries can be linked directly into any standard C++ application
 * A template class can inherit from QObject
 * CopperSpice includes several existing Qt 5 classes
 * The CopperSpice libraries were built using GNU Autotools
 * CopperSpice makes extensive use of C++11 features like variadic templates,
   constexpr, lambdas, atomics, and many others

CopperSpice currently consists of the libraries listed below. Additional
libraries will be added as development continues.

 * CsCore
 * CsGui
 * CsMultimedia
 * CsNetwork
 * CsOpenGL
 * CsPhonon
 * CsScript
 * CsSql
 * CsSvg
 * CsWebKit
 * CsXml
 * CsXmlPatterns

We have made the process of converting to CopperSpice simple and straight
forward. Simply convert your Qt application header files one time using our
PepperMill utility. The Makefiles from our sample KitchenSink and Diamond
Editor applications can be used as a guide to create your project files.
